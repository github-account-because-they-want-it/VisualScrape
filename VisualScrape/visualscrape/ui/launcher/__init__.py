"""
How will the launcher be like?.
Each spider will have a start, MAYBE resume (according to it's config
info). And there'll be also spider groups, which are launched together.
Anything else?
How to launch a group?. maybe one or more groups?.
Well, this seems like a natural tree view, where the user
can choose one or more groups and launch.
The groups should be on disk. And the launcher should save them
there. 
Should there be any menus for the launcher?.
The spider can also be deleted, so it'll have a delete button.
That's it!
Are you sure you want the tree view for the spider groups?. Are you sure
you want it to be always visible?. Yes, for now.
